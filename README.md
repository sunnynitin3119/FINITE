FINITE — iOS Habit Tracker (SwiftUI)

FINITE is a minimalist iOS habit-tracking application designed to help users build consistency through a simple, visual dot-based system. The app focuses on clarity, performance, and native iOS best practices without relying on third-party dependencies.

Overview

FINITE enables users to track daily habits using an intuitive grid interface where each interaction represents progress. The project emphasizes clean architecture, SwiftUI state management, and lightweight local persistence.

This project was built to demonstrate strong fundamentals in native iOS development, UI composition, and data handling.

Key Features
	•	SwiftUI-first architecture using modern declarative UI patterns
	•	Tap-to-complete habit tracking with instant visual feedback
	•	Persistent local storage using UserDefaults
	•	Haptic feedback to enhance user interaction
	•	Minimal, distraction-free UI focused on usability
	•	Zero third-party libraries (fully native implementation)

Technical Stack
	•	Language: Swift
	•	UI Framework: SwiftUI
	•	State Management: @State
	•	Layout: LazyVGrid
	•	Persistence: UserDefaults
	•	Platform: iOS 16+
	•	IDE: Xcode

Architecture & Implementation Notes
	•	Uses SwiftUI’s state-driven rendering for predictable UI updates
	•	Grid-based UI implemented with LazyVGrid for performance efficiency
	•	Local persistence handled via lightweight key-value storage
	•	Clean separation between UI logic and state updates
	•	Designed to scale into more advanced persistence (CoreData / CloudKit)
  Why This Project

This project demonstrates:
	•	Strong understanding of SwiftUI fundamentals
	•	Practical use of state management and layout systems
